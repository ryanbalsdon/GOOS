 GOOS
 Duck-typing library for C
 
 This lib was originally put together to port some Python code to C. Taking
this approach is a very, very bad idea! It's much easier (and maintainable) 
to just use standard C techniques instead of trying to shoehorn in interpreted
launguage approaches. I haven't yet found a use for this code but if you do,
please let me know!

 The Makefile included will build a testset that can be used to validate any
changes made to the lib. Otherwise, just pull the files into your project.

 For usage examples, please see the testcases set up in the testClass()
function of test.c.

 Good luck and fly safe!
